# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodgree Program. 

In this program I learned how to organize data, uncover
patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. Also
developing in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL.
